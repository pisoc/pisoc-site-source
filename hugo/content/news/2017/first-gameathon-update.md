An upate on the gameathon - we will indeed be having drinks and snacks for free at the event. 

We should (all things going to plan) also have two Raspberry Pis to give away as prizes. One will go to the winner of a free-for-all at the begining of the gameathon (so get there on time to participate!), and the other will go to the winner of a tournament we will run over the course of the event.

#### We look forward to seeing you there, and hope you don't frag us too many times!

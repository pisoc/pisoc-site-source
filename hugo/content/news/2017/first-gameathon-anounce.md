#### I'm happy to announce that PiSoc is holding another gameathon on the 8th of March.

It'll be between 2 and about 6:30, in D1.24 (the postgrad research lab). We'll be playing [Xonotic](http://www.xonotic.org/), a [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) Quake 3 Arena/Unreal Tournament clone. If you're intested in fast, twitchy FPS action, come along to our gameathon! 

Food and drink may or may not be provided, we're working on that :P

## It's [penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)) time, PiSoc!

On 21/10/19 (at the time of writing, the coming Monday), we'll be holding our first PiSoc presents lecture, as well as this semester's Linux Install Party.

### PiSoc Presents: Linux 101

Are you interested in Linux, but don't know where to start?

Does the command line confuse you?

Do you want to learn some things and eat free [(as in free pizza)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#%22Free_beer%22_vs_%22freedom_of_speech%22_distinction) pizza?

Starting from 18:15, we'll be delivering a lecture on the fundamentals of Linux-based operating systems, how they work and how to use them. The talk is planned to run for about 30 minutes. All skill levels are welcome, and we'll be starting from the very basics - so don't worry if you're a complete [n00b](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noob).

### Linux Install Party

After a brief intermission for the aforementioned free pizza, we'll be starting our Linux Install Party at 19:00. If you want to have a crack at installing Linux on your laptop (replacing or alongside Windows), we'll provide the tools and guidance to support you in doing so.

**IF YOU PLAN ON INSTALLING LINUX WITH US, PLEASE BACK UP YOUR FILES BEFORE COMING TO OUR EVENT - WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT OCOURS IF YOU FAIL TO DO SO!**

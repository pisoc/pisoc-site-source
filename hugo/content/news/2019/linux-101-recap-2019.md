## [Penguin time](/news/linux-101-and-install-party-2019/) was fun!

Last week, we had a special PiSoc weekly meeting - our very first PiSoc Presents! Our Social Exec, Tom Mitchell, gave a lecture on "an introduction to Linux". The talk covered what we mean by "Linux as a kernel" and "as an OS", and the "what", "why" and "how" of Linux-based operating systems.

Incase you missed it, you can view/download the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q_8909c6akzb8yJZHaPy1EH70iR2yqFe6Vq2JqbnYV8/edit?usp=sharing).

We hope you all learned something and enjoyed the free pizza!

#### PiSoc has yet another event coming up! 

This time, it's a penetration testing bootcamp. Here you can learn some hacking skills (for ETHICAL USE ONLY). It's taking place on the 25th of March (25/03/17), between 9am and about 6pm. It's an all day affair, so you know it's serious business. We'll be using the CS deparment's swanky new pentesting labs, too! No background in cyber security is required, and it's free to all PiSoc members.

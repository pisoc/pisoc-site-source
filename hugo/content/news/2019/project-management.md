## Let's get organised, PiSoc!

We'll soon be running our next **PiSoc Presents** - this time we'll be teaching you about **project management and organisation**.

Our talk will take place on **Monday 11th November, starting at 18:45**. We'll be teaching you the "what", "why" and "how" of **Git**, Git repository hosts **(Github/Gitlab)**, and **Trello**.

If you don't already use these tools and services, **your projects will greatly benefit from them**. They're great for keeping your work organised - as well as displaying it online after the fact. You can also use them to **keep the group projects** you'll run up against during your degree **running smoothly and on-time**.

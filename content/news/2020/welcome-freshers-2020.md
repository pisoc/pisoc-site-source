## Hi there, freshers of 2020!

If you've not already been introduced, we're Pi Society, but you can call us PiSoc. Our focus is on computer science (and occasionally maths and electrical engineering). We're a motley crew of hackers, makers, technologists, and nerds.

We've got a load of interesting events on the horizon. Part of the roadmap for this year is as follows:

 * A trip to an as-of-yet-undecided destination to be chosen by you, the members of PiSoc
 * Society projects - the university has greenlit us building them a [magic mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8swdfbnZn9E) for public display
 * CTF(Catch The Flag), a hacking Competitions where your objective is to find clues and complete the challenge
 * Linux install parties - we'll help you Linux-ify your laptop
 * Gameathons - play video games
 * Weekly meetings and socials


We also get up to fun nerdy shenanigans like [reversing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) bluetooth-powered kids toys, developing [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bots when we're at the pub, or building terrible robots out of microcontrollers, hot glue and cardboard.

### Pisoc Presents
